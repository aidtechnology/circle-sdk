Package accounts provides access to Circle's Accounts APIs.

The API allows you to easily create and manage accounts and balances for
your customers, and execute transfers of funds across accounts - whether
they are within the Circle platform, or in / out of the platform via
on-chain USDC connectivity.

  - Accept USDC deposits with minimum cost and no exposure to reversals.
  - Support BTC and ETH balances in addition to USDC.
  - Embed US Dollar denominated accounts into your product or service without
    dealing with the complexity of legacy bank account structures.
  - Manage a multi-asset accounts infrastructure for your customers including
    seamless transfer of funds, across hosted accounts or via on-chain USDC
    connectivity.
