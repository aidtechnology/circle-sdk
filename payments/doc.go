Package payments provides access to Circle's payments API and related functionality.

The Circle Payments API allows you to take payments from your end users via
traditional methods such as debit & credit cards, bank accounts, etc., and
receive settlement in USDC. Businesses with users already holding USDC are
also able to take on-chain payments on supported blockchains.
